Led the development of six innovative product initiatives within two years, working closely with product managers, data scientists, and UX designers. Addressed critical operational challenges by designing and implementing targeted solutions. Synchronized technology and business strategies through agile development practices, including managing sprint planning sessions and maintaining consistent communication with all stakeholders. Successfully launched multiple products to production, now actively maintained and continually updated to adapt to evolving business requirements.
Extensive AI and Azure OpenAI Expertise:
Skill Plan Assist: Engineered a full-stack application with TypeScript React and .NET C# API, integrating our 'AI Recommender Service' and GPT-4. This system efficiently recommends Microsoft Learn content and generates skilling summaries and targeted outcomes from sales data, significantly improving the customization, relevance, and impact of training programs for organizational learning, thereby boosting educational ROI and strategic alignment. [Azure Cognitive Services, CosmosDB]
LLM AccuCheck: Developed an ExpressJS API for LLM content verification, employing a multi-tiered validation process that rigorously checks each layer's output. This system is integral to our AI-generated assessment authoring service, enhancing the accuracy and trustworthiness of content provided to assessment authors. The project incorporates comprehensive prompt engineering, cost-efficiency optimization, and rate limiting, ensuring operational efficiency while maintaining customer trust and safety. [Azure Cognitive Services, CosmosDB]
Microsoft Branded AI Assist: Developed a single-page React application with an Express.js backend API in TypeScript, simulating a ChatGPT-like experience tailored to Microsoft’s branding. This design-centric project helped to steer the AI Copilot concept for MS Learn. Collaborated closely with UX teams to conduct user focus groups, gauging responses to learners using an AI assistant.  The iterative process contributed to establishing best practices for AI copilot integration across Microsoft's products, improving AI safety and bolstering customer trust. [Azure OpenAI]
Developed a 'Cookbook for Container-based Workflows' in a Git repository, providing detailed recipes for .NET APIs in C# and React applications in TypeScript. This guide includes best practices and onboarding materials for new Microsoft developers. The resource was pivotal in helping four partner teams adopt container-based workflows, leading to significant Azure cost reductions quarterly. This contribution has enhanced the technical skills and flexibility of our engineering teams, underscoring our dedication to ongoing learning and improvement. [Container Apps, Docker, KeyVault]
Implemented and enforced advanced security measures, aligning with industry standards such as ISO 27001 and SOC2. Integrated Azure Key Vault for secure secrets management, Azure Virtual Networks for enhanced network isolation, and Private Endpoints to secure connections to Azure services. Utilized App Insights Telemetry for comprehensive real-time monitoring and troubleshooting. Conducted extensive threat modeling and data classification reviews to ensure compliance with strict security standards. Proactively addressed and remediated vulnerabilities in our applications and infrastructure.

Sept 2020 to Feb 2022

Worked closely with product managers/owners to define technical requirements and delivery roadmaps for multi-tenant, public facing API products; duties included defining API requirements based on product designs, building development teams, and coordinating cross-functional efforts.
Developed Nodejs APIs to interface with postgreSQL databases. Challenges included parallel development of database structure, complex data-model associations, and adapting API architectures including serverless framework, AWS SAM, and elastic beanstalk. [Typescript, Javascript]
Created AWS Cloudformation templates from scratch to deploy an AWS codepipeline for environment deployment and testing. This allowed the team to adopt CI/CD processes for application development.
Delivered authentication and authorization solutions using Oauth Bearer access tokens issued from Azure AD B2C tenants. Allowed API keys for specific endpoints. Included automated deployment of AWS WAF for additional security. These security instruments are critical to protecting the application + users.
Software Engineer - GE Healthcare - Seattle, WA
Nov 2017 to Sept 2020

Worked closely with product managers/owners, architects, engineers, UX, tech writers, and leadership to develop three new product initiatives; duties included gathering customer feedback, building POCs, performing demos, developing roadmaps, forming engineering teams, and coordinating cross-functional efforts. [AWS, Python, Apigee, Kubernetes]
Led adaptation of Apigee as the primary API management solution for all of GE Healthcare services. Major challenges included complex networking solutions and maintaining HIPAA compliance with strict security standards.
Managed customer operations for 20+ development teams across the globe as they integrated with Edison Developer Portal resulting in 800 registered users, 30 GE partners, 300 published catalog items, 150+ APIs, and 1.6M API calls. [Apigee, Drupal]
Developed multi-tenant data ingestion pipeline for DICOM images, capturing and storing metadata in DynamoDB that would become essential for GE Healthcare machine-learning applications focused on diagnosis assistance. [AWS, Python]

PROJECTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Microsoft Hackathon 2022 - Gold Star Project

Website: https://gold-star-project.vercel.app/
Launched the Gold Star Project at the Microsoft Hackathon 2022 with my colleague David Markham to transform how motivational rewards are perceived. Our vision was to replace traditional 2D accolades with interactive 3D trophies for achievements such as Azure labs, designed to engage users more deeply through dynamic animations and effects upon interaction.
Enlisted the expertise of three Microsoft designers—Caleb, Angie, and Olga—who used Blender to create visually stunning 3D models and produce engaging concept art. 
Integrated the 3D models into a web interface using Babylon.js within a TypeScript-based React application. This approach allowed us to demonstrate the trophies in a real-time, interactive web environment during the hackathon, showcasing the seamless fusion of cutting-edge web technologies and creative design to a broad audience.

Microsoft AI Talk - Let's Talk about ChatGPT, Dec 2022

Led a dynamic presentation to 300 colleagues on the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs), showcasing OpenAI's latest developments and Microsoft's role in advancing AI technology. Facilitated discussions on integrating AI to enhance organizational efficiency and innovation.
Later invited to conduct a tailored presentation for 200 members of the Microsoft Video Production team, featuring a collaboration with Adobe. Facilitated a demonstration and exclusive early access to Adobe Firefly, showcasing its innovative use in enhancing video production and creative processes.

Microsoft Learn - Lab Manager

Developed a robust single-page React application using TypeScript, enabling users to instantly earn certifications directly from third-party labs. This system replaced a previous process where users might wait up to 48 hours, significantly enhancing the efficiency of obtaining credentials and leading to the creation of the Microsoft Applied Skills program on Microsoft Learn.
